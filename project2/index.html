        <p>South Korea,officially the Republic of Korea (ROK),is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the
            southern part of the Korean Peninsula and borders North Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; though it
            also claims the land border with China and Russia.The country's western border is formed by the Yellow
            Sea, while its eastern border is defined by the Sea of Japan. South Korea claims to be the sole legitimate
            government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. It has a population of 51.96 million, of which half
            live in the Seoul Capital Area, the ninth most populous metropolitan area in the world. Other major cities
            include Busan, Daegu, and Incheon.</p>

        <p>K-pop, short for Korean popular music, is a form of popular music originating in South Korea as part of South
            Korean culture. It includes styles and genres from around the world, such as pop, hip hop, R&B, rock, jazz,
            gospel, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, disco, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music
            roots. The term "K-pop" became popular in the 2000s, especially in the international context. The Korean
            term for domestic pop music is gayo, which is still widely used within South Korea. While "K-pop" can refer
            to all popular music or pop music from South Korea, it is colloquially often used in a narrower sense for
            any Korean music and artists associated with the entertainment and idol industry in the country, regardless
            of the genre.
